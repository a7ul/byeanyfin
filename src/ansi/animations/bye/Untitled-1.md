Hej 👋

----
Today is my last day here ☹️ (potentially)

I am going on a six month sabbatical to build a startup.
(Worst time 🤷‍♂️, I know 🤣)

I wanted to take a moment to thank you and convey my deep gratitude ❤️ ...

----

Feb 2019 ...

----

- I met with Sven, Husse and Filip and instantly knew that I wanted to work here.
- The passion, honesty and kindness was contagious. I was sold.


----

Over last four exciting years,
I was given blind trust and freedom to work on things that I was passionate about.

Things I am proud of

- The amazing engineering team we have
- The modern tech stack we built
- Going from "I work at a startup called Anyfin. It's a swedish fintech startup" to just "I work at Anyfin" and people recognising.


----

I am going to miss

My people ❤️

I am grateful to have worked with some of the kindest and brightest minds in the industry.
I am lucky to call them my friends.


---

Three things I learnt here

- Always be action oriented - Get stuff out and make decisions based on the current scale
- Focus on solutions not the problem (everyone sees the problem, work hard to solve problems)
- Drive the change you wish to see. You have more influence than you think.


----

What next? 2023...

----

I am taking a leap of faith and building Magic (https://magicrefunds.com) with my co-founder Leroy.

I am both super excited and equally terrified 😬🤞  
But honestly, I have a warm home to come back to if things go south ❤️

----
 
I will be in Stockholm and up for fikas, aw's, dinners, sports.... (Invite me, please 😬)
Anyfin has special place in my heart and I will always be cheering for you all ❤️

Lets stay in touch. I am always up for a chat.
